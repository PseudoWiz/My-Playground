# My-Playground

This repo is my creative lab – a place to learn, break things, test ideas, and build technical fluency across WebGL, Three.js, Blender Python, and general scripting.

### Experiments

- `experiments/webgl/starter/` – Raw WebGL
- `experiments/threejs/starter/` – Three.js scenes
- `experiments/blender/starter/` – Blender Python automation
- `experiments/python/starter/` – CLI Python tools

### Notes

- `notes/00-learning-log.md`
- `notes/01-ideas.md`

Everything here is meant to evolve as I evolve.
